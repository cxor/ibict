\subsection{Environmental Sustainability}
FCA has always been aware of the fact that petrol engines cars are one of main cause of environmental pollution, between many others. Being the ignition mechanisms the root of the problem itself, it's clear that it represents the starting point for a research of more ecologically sustainable solutions.
The first pivotal result came with, LPG gas based engines, almost 30 years ago, and since the launch of the first LPG vehicle, FCA is still one of the biggest producer of natural gas vehicles in the world \cite{FCA_sustainability}.
Nowadays LPG gas usage is considered more a short term solution, rather than a definitive one, and there are many reasons behind such perspective. The rationale is than LPG gas is not a renewable resource and, although not harmful as conventional petrol -as a combustible-, is still a not-towards-zero pollution method of ignition. As a result, FCA is experimenting different approaches, where the most significant one are electrical engines; although electricity can still questionably be considered not mature enough for a mass scale adoption, FCA has undergone some attempts to reach the market, as showed by the launch of five new completely electric Maserati models \cite{Maserati_electric}. The reasons behind considering electricity a final solution to the automotive pollution problem is underlying the fact that most of it is produced from non-renewable sources, which virtually doesn't add any benefit from an ecological standpoint.
Another equally critical aspect is that environmental pollution problem doesn't involve only the automotive companies, but also the customers: for instance, the three most sold vehicles in the US are all pickup trucks \cite{US_best-selling-vehicle}. This is due to the relatively low price of the vehicles in this category, and the almost unbeatable price of the required gasoline. These aspects, together with reliability and versatility concerns, are making customers much more prone to buy a pick-up rather than a smaller, greener car.
Given the complex nature of the problem, which intuitively has many fading shadows under its amplitude, FCA is trying to properly tackle the necessity of a sustainable transportation still pushing LPG technology for the upcoming years, but evaluating a diversified range of alternatives, heavily investing on the research of solutions which can fulfill the purpose, also if they appear immature at the present moment.
Conducting a successful business is not a mere process of introducing innovative ideas and technologies, but also to spot the right time when a certain solution has reached enough maturity to be effectively posed on the market. Exploiting this adequate level of maturity, consensus can be gained through mediatic momentum and therefore revenues will be automatically triggered. FCA knows it, and that's the actual motivation behind the conservative position about electric vehicles and their spreading as today.

\subsection{Maintenance}

As a matter of fact, petrol cars have much more complex mechanisms compared to electric cars, in order to make the entire system work correctly. This also involves having more elements that need to be recycled or disposed of, both during the lifecycle of the vehicles and at the end of it.

The owners of a petrol engine cars have more maintenance costs compared to the ones of an electric vehicles. For instance, \emph{the average cost to operate an EV(Electric Vehicle) in the United States is \$485 per year, while the average for a gasoline-powered vehicle is \$1,117}\cite{maintenance_costs}. 

But what is FCA doing to meet the needs of its customers when it comes to vehicle maintenance? The answer is Mopar. 

With more than 80 years of experience, Mopar provides expert service, genuine parts and customer care specifically for the FCA vehicles around the globe\cite{maintenance_mopar}. 
The main goal of Mopar is to offer every possible part and accessory for each FCA model, from the SUVs to the smallest selling vehicles of the brand. Moreover, this elements are engineered by following factory-authorized specifications, and this guarantee that each one will perfectly fit inside the vehicles\cite{maintenance_mopar}.

In conclusion, \emph{Mopar is not only here to service cars, trucks, minivans and SUVs—it is a brand here to service people’s lives. This commitment defines who we are and fuels what we do. For this reason, everything we say and everything we do is aligned with the Mopar brand purpose:
ALL IN SERVICE OF THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE US.}\cite{maintenance_mopar}
