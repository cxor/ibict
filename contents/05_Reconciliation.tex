% Here is where your report should focus on: the reconciliation between the two views. As you know, when dealing with ambiguity it’s impossible to agree with one opinion or another. You probably saw this when we conducted polls in the class: sometimes we had strong differences, sometimes they were way more balanced. In ambiguity you base your decision on your preferences, your beliefs, your values, and then you use the retrospective rationality to justify them… However, is there only one “right” side? How can you assess what is right and what is not? Often, the result is in the middle, in a reconciliation between the two extreme views, where there is no absolute winner or loser. This is the work which we ask of you here. In this reconciliation you should create a third story, what we call a “fair tale”, that merges the two “fairy tales” which you told when the views were opposed. Try to maximize the upsides of each view and minimize the downsides… What emerges? In a Hegelian fashion, this is a synthesis that has been enriched by the antithesis, and which is more than a mere compromise between the two parts.
