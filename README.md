## Fiat Chrysler Automobiles vs Tesla Automotors

- Feel free to create files in raws/ directory
- Please consider master branch as the stable version:
	* do not commit on master if your work is highly provisional and needs somewhat heavy revision
	* create your own branch instead
- Please avoid to edit files owned by others in order to avoid merge conflicts
- In general terms: keep the project repo clean, think before commit, and commit smartly :)
