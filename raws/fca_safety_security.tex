\subsection{Safety and Security}
in FCA we think that is not only important to create faster and nicer car to please the customers but also we want to ensure him that his car will be a safe and secure place for him and his family. For achieve this result FCA follows two different way, on one hand FCA innovate to create new systems that are more effective to avoid incidents and breaks or to protect the passengers if they happens. On the other hand FCA commit to help costumers when some unexpected problems happens.

\subsubsection*{Innovation}
Aiming to create always safer components FCA invest over 4,2 billion \$, that represent the 3,9\% of net revenues from industrial operations \cite{FCASafety}, to make our vehicles more and more innovative to reduce even the probability that an mechanical problem occurs even the damage that a passengers can receive when is not possible to avoid the breaks.

\subsubsection{Over the selling}
We in FCA want to create for customers the best experience buying and using our cars, for this reason we can't leave clients without assistance when and if a problem occurs and to handle this situation we create a brand, Mopar \cite{Mopar}, which is specialized to help buyer whit spare parts, warranty and maintenance.
