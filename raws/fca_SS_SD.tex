\subsection{Safety and Security}
in FCA we think that is not only important to create faster and nicer car to please the customer but also we want to ensure him that their car will be a safe and secure place for him and his family. For achieve this result FCA follows two different way, on one hand FCA innovate to create new systems that are more effective to avoid incidents and breaks or to protect the passengers if they happens. On the other hand FCA commit to help costumers when some unexpected problems happens.

\subsubsection{Innovation}
Aiming to create always safer components FCA invest over 4,2 billion \$, that represent the 3,9\% of net revenues from industrial operations \cite{FCASafety}, to make our vehicles more and more innovative to reduce even the probability that an mechanical problem occurs even the damage that a passengers can receive when is not possible to avoid the breaks. Research is lead by 87 centers world wide spread with more than 20.000 of employees. Thanks to the innovation process FCA produce a broad range of different innovative solution such as advanced propulsion system like the full electric one mounted in the Fiat500e, the hybrid system used in JEEP, RAM and Chrysler or different engine powered by alternative fuels (Compressed Natural Gas, ethanol or bio-methane). Another important Innovation is the driving automations which is develop through 2 different ways\cite{FCASD} that goes hand-in-hand:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{The evolution way} We are developing our own technology, our Maserati is already offering highway assistance driver and Chrysler with his portal concept represent an conditional automation, whit the ability to be upgraded to high automation, level 4 of our progressively driver automation. \ref{fig:level}
	\item \textit{The revolution way} In collaboration with Google we are working to deliver highly autonomous vehicles to Waymo service, a revolutionary service of driver-less ride-hailing, which add thousands of Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids to its existing fleet, and also 62000 Pacifica Hybrid minivans, to supply both private and fleet customers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Over the selling}
We in FCA want to create for customers the best experience buying and using our cars, for this reason we can't leave clients without assistance when and if a problem occurs and to handle this situation we have a brand: Mopar \cite{Mopar} created by Chrysler in 1920, is specialized to help buyer whit spare parts, warranty and maintenance. Working alongside the car producer Mopar ensure a quality and a compatibility of parts that no others company can provide, moreover Mopar provides after-selling assistance such as the Mopar vehicle protection that aim to guaranteed a complete assistance service making sure that your vehicle is safe and efficient during all his life.


\section{Self-driving cars}

FCA started a strategic partnership with the self-driving car service Waymo, belonging under the Alphabet umbrella, since May 2016. The CEO at the time Sergio Marchionne commented: “Strategic partnerships, such as the one we have with Waymo, will help to drive innovative technology to the forefront.”, “FCA is committed to bringing self-driving technology to our customers in a manner that is safe, efficient and realistic”. FCA is committed to produce 62,000 Chrysler hybrid minivans to the self-driving car service Waymo (FCAW). With the commitment FCA is proving, that the company is serious about the commercialization of self-driving cars. Furthermore the company is a first-move in case the market should suddenly change to favor self-driving cars.

A scenario (not mentioned during the battle) is that self-driving cars could be a better option compared to a conventional car for the customer, since todays cars are parked 95% of the time (fortune). It is obvious that a car service such as Waymo can utilize their shared carpool between customers, such that the cars are parked a smaller percentage of the time. This could add several socio-economical values such as cheaper transportation due to the higher utilization of the carpool. Time savings since a car can be ordered to a precise pick-up and drop-off location, and the traveller does not have to park the car. The scenario would definitely have been mentioned in the case of a customer audience, however a demand for a smaller carpool could mean less income to the car manufacturers. So the scenario may not be beneficial to mention for an audience of investors.

During the battle

An investor raised concerns that Tesla would be regarded as unsafe, as he mentioned a case of an accident involving a Tesla car using the Autopilot assisted driving system, where the driver demanded full coverage of the damages claiming that it was a fault of the system, but Tesla denied that. Another investor asked in which regards FCA is innovative and visionary as he was unconvinced. It was mentioned that FCA are coming out with a series of electric car models from their different brands, among them models from Masserati to compete on the high-end market of Tesla. Furthermore the strategic partnership with Waymo was mentioned as an innovative undertaking. Team Tesla responded that a recent survey had revealed that 75% thought they would feel unsafe/uncomfortable using the Waymo service. This was countered by FCA by stating that Waymo cars use radar sensing technology, which is regarded to be safer, although more expensive than the Autopilot system. Tesla countered by saying that the technologies are hard to compare, since Autopilot is an assisted driving technology, whereas the technology of Waymo is fully driverless.

Keywords before closing statement
Tesla succeeded in being regarded as the most innovative of the two companies by receiving keyword innovative, whereas FCA succeeded in being regarded as the manufacturer of the safest cars by receiving keyword safer. The keyword safer could also have been associated to investment purposes as FCA claimed to appear to a broader market and putting their eggs in multiple baskets by manufacturing both gasoline-, hydrogen-, hybrid and electrically driven cars.
